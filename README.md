# ProgEx â€” Run Code Anywhere

**ProgEx** is a Chrome Extension that allows you to run programming code instantly from any web page â€” without switching to an IDE or online compiler.  

Whether you are reading documentation, browsing Stack Overflow, or scrolling through GitHub repos, you can highlight a code snippet, click a small floating icon, and immediately see its output in a popup right on the same page.

## ðŸš€ What is this?

ProgEx is your **mini-universal compiler** inside your browser.  
You donâ€™t need to copy â†’ paste â†’ select language â†’ run on another site.  
Just **select the code** â†’ click the floating **ProgEx icon** â†’ output appears instantly.

## âš™ How it Works

1. **Select code** on any webpage.
2. A small **floating ProgEx icon** appears near the selection.
3. Click the icon.
4. The extension **auto-detects the programming language** or uses your chosen language.
5. It sends the code to a secure **Code Execution API** (Piston API).
6. The API runs your code in a sandbox and returns:
   - Output (standard output)
   - Error logs (if any)
7. The extension displays the results **in a popup overlay** right where you selected the code.
